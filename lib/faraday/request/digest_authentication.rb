module Faraday
  # Public: A Faraday middleware to use digest authentication. Since order of
  # middlewares do care, it should be the first one of the Request middlewares
  # in order to work properly (due to how digest authentication works).
  #
  # If some requests using the connection don't need to use digest auth you
  # don't have to worry, the middleware will do nothing.
  #
  # It uses Net::HTTP::DigestAuth to generate the authorization header but it
  # should work with any adapter.
  #
  # Examples:
  #
  #   connection = Faraday.new(...) do |connection|
  #     connection.request :digest, USER, PASSWORD
  #   end
  #
  #   # You can also use it later with a connection:
  #   connection.digest_auth('USER', 'PASSWORD')
  #
  class Request::DigestAuth < Faraday::Middleware

    # Public: Initializes a DigestAuth.
    #
    # app      - The Faraday app.
    # user     - A String with the user to authentication the connection.
    # password - A String with the password to authentication the connection.
    def initialize(app, user, password)
      super(app)
      @user, @password = user, password
    end

    # Public: Sends a first request with an empty body to get the
    # authentication headers and then send the same request with the body and
    # authorization header.
    #
    # env - A Hash with the request environment.
    #
    # Returns a Faraday::Response.
